Final Project Proposal

Project Title: Worldwide EV/ICE car sales Time Series Analysis 

Team Name : Kimi Chi

Project Objectives : 
Based on global automotive market data in major regions, analyze and visualize vehicle electrification sales and trends over the past two decades, and make predictions for future vehicle electrification.
Analyze and visualize the growing share of electric vehicles in the Chinese market based on global market data, and predict the future share of gasoline/electric vehicles.

Project Description:
In a world where technology and ecological consciousness work together, the shift to green transport and a more affordable "fuel "- electricity - is accelerating at an unprecedented rate. As we embark on a new era of sustainable mobility, electric vehicles are capturing the hearts and minds of consumers around the world thanks to improved technology and increased environmental awareness.
Recently, major European OEMs announced that they would abandon the strategy of full electrification by 2035, and then continue to produce fuel vehicles to compete with the electric vehicle market. On the contrary, Chinese OEMs and the market are entering the era of full electrification and intelligence vehicle area. Through this project, people such as the marketing strategy Department of the automotive industry can analyze and predict the future trend of polarization in the automotive market, and timely adjust the regional production and development strategy.

Dataset:
Daily vehicle sales from 2005 to 2023. 
This dataset was created by MIT in 2017 and used to store the sales data on different brands and predict future potential markets.
